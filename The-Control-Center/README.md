THE CONTROL CENTER =>
---------------------
* NEEDS A CENTER, NEEDS TO HAVE A CENTER
* NEEDS CONTROLS, NEEDS ELEMENTS OF CONTROL
  * THE CENTER CAN BE VIRTUAL, BUT MUST BE IMMUTABLE IN ITS ROLE, RESPONSIBILITY
  * THE CENTER CAN BE MOVED, BUT MUST BE CAPABLE OF BEING FIXED, AND MUST BE AT-CENTER BY DEFAULT, AT THE IDEAL CENTER
  * OR ELSE IT'S NOT WORTH HAVING A CENTER AND NOT WORK BUILDING AN APP USING THE CONTROL CENTER PARADIGM
    * CONTROLS => THEY MUST ACTUALLY CONTROL THINGS
    * A CONTROL SIGNAL CAN BE AS LITTLE AS A 1-BIT SIGNAL => YES/NO? UP/DOWN? RIGHT/LEFT?
    * THE CONTROLS MUST RADIATE OMNIDIRECTIONALLY AROUND THE CENTER, FROM THE CENTER
    * MOST IMPORTANT CONTROLS => NEAREST-TO-CENTER
* TOP-OF-MIND, NEAREST-TO-CENTER, SIMILAR TO SPHERE-PACKING, BUT JUST CENTERING OF CONTROLS TOWARDS THE CENTER SO THAT IT CAN ACT AS CENTER
