* How to do the Impossible:
 * What Has Helped Me In Matters of Great Complexity?
 * Thinking it through all the way. Stop and think. Slow down. One decision at a time + sit and wait.
 * Bursts & Heavy-Tails, Strategic Bursts and Doctrinal-Tactical Long-Tails. Know your genosociogram, follow Moral Temperatures, Moral Climate.
 * Slow & Constant Unveiling.
 * Move slowly forward on all fronts, be consistent, stick to your guns, a slow unveiling; then quick sporadic cluster-bursts; stick to the theory when you don't or can't know; trust your predictions in a few key areas; believe nothing instantly; know your material; be tireless; take risks with Face behavior; be self-reliant, autonomous, resourceful, innovative.
