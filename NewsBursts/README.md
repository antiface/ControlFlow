##NewsBursts and The Long Tail of Analysis
* Separation of Concerns: NewsBursts vs. Analytical Long Tail
* NewsBursts: Rapid newsreading, scanning, browsing, collecting news items.
* Tagging and classifying news items, always rapidly.
* Iterative: Lather, Rinse, Repeat. You consume news items rapidly, in what is hereby conceived as the "NewsBurst".
* You scan through headlines, marking articles you want to read, tagging when needed, classifying when you can.

##Part II: The Long Tail of Analysis
* Separation of Concerns: Separate system internally. This one is about going over what you did in NewsBursts.
* Here you read articles marked as To Read, keep tagging and classifying as you go. This is a slower process, more focused.

##Tips
* Open and close sets of browser tabs at the touch of a button.
* Save lists of open tabs on a regular basis, on the desktop (you already are saving everything in the cloud, but you keep a copy of your browser usage on the desktop, and in at least two other locations in flash drives or external hard-drives, PLUS at least one location that is NOT on the same premises.)
* News that comes to you. Be able to do a news "mass capture". Go through several hundred articles in little time.
* An Outliner open so you can strategize and keep a running tab of Categories of news content.
* Build up and take down taxonomic structures. Classify on the fly, Just-in-Time Ontological Thinking.
* Know what you're doing and where you're going. Open and close tabs, read headlines, dig deeper when needed.
* Keep an eye on the horizon through environmental scanning. Question everything. Question everything. Question everything.
* Make your work environment low-complexity, low in energy usage in every sense of the term.
* Dim lights when you can, turn computer off whenever you can. Try to do the LEAST AMOUNT OF WORK POSSIBLE.
* MINIMIZE INPUTS, MAXIMIZE OUTPUTS. But when reading news, in the news-burst, MAXIMIZE INPUTS, MINIMIZE OUTPUTS. Go through several hundred articles and crunch it down to 2-line segments. Keep a running tabe of 2-liners on your news-bursts. Go to Heavy-Tailed Analysis. Keep all BURSTS SHORT. Synchronize BURSTY BEHAVIOR with your co-workers. Bursts at the same time, Heavy Tails the rest of the time. Early morning burst, mid-day burst, end-of-day burst, and bursts ON-CALL.
